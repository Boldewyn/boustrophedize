                               Writing like an ox

Boustrophedon (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boustrophedon) is the name of the
writing system, that turned round after every line. While the odd lines run
from left to right, the even ones are mirrored and run from right to left.

This Javascript library tries to mimic that behaviour in HTML. It is in early
alpha state and currently works only

- in Firefox, and

- for elements with only a single text node as children
